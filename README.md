# **MedSynora Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**
Welcome to the MedSynora Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. It is designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

**🏗️ Data Architecture**
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
- Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

**📖 Project Overview**
This project involves:

- Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
